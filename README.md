**Y**ea this is a nice problem I think,
[clck!](https://ioinformatics.org/files/ioi1997problem4.pdf)

It seems like *\[ b a c k t r c k \]*, the other issue is
finding overlapping labels, and that's like a trap, becoz
there are similar search problems using techniques like
binary search trees etc., which is a problem of it's own,
but here we don't need that stuff.

By the way recently the Pentagon had confirmed UFO videos,
and this is my message to these alien bastards, you don't
know who you are messing with. The God of the all Universe
is from this planet!!! Yea
